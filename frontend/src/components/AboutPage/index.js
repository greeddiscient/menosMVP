        <p className="about-content">At Menos, we believe in the pursuit of excellence and reaching our fullest potential. We want to achieve our goals with integrity.
This would not be possible without role models that we respect in our lives. We need someone to guide us on the long and uncertain road to success. <br/><br/>Mentorship has been an ancient common theme in the symbols of our world. From the innate Father - Son relationship, to the classic Master - Apprentice discipleship, to war heroes such as Alexander the Great - Aristotle, and even to popular culture where Luke Skywalker seeks guidance from Obi Wan and Yoda before he goes on to save the universe, mentorship is everywhere. <br/><br/> Menos is our way of connecting you Indonesians to highly established mentors who will give you the best guidance for your quest. <br/><br/>Become the Strongest Version of Yourself!  </p>
